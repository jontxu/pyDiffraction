# pyDiffraction

Diffraction pattern graphing scripts, originally made for an Fundamentals of Optics Instrumentation class. There are three scripts that make a matplotlib graph given the wavelength, slit length and/or separation.

The scripts are these:

- `singleslitdiffraction.py`: Single slit diffraction pattern
- `doubleslitinterference.py`: Double-slit experiment interference pattern
- `doubleslitdiffraction.py`: Double-slit experiment interference pattern modulated by the diffraction pattern.
